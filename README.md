# Telecommunication_Customer_Churn_Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project includes features related to customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

## Steps Involved
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Data Splitting: Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Model Training: Training various classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
- Feature Importance: Using SHAP for interpretability and understanding feature importance.
- Results and Conclusion: Analyzing the results and selecting the best model for predicting churn.

## Instructions for Running the Code
